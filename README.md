# Javagame

A small game played directly inside the IDE, it will take you on an adventure of becoming a developer!

The game utilises a map structure for the levels, which makes it very easy to connect to other levels and is scaleable, adding new levels is easy.

It can also take in commands in a few ways, a single letter (like W for west), an entire word (WEST) and also works with adding other words (please go west)
  However, it will pick up the first keyword it encounters, so (please go east west) will either go east or activate the (Cant go there) message , if you cant go that way.
